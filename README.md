# Arduino-Sensors

A "Library" of Libraries of Sensors. Infrared, Ultrasonic, Compass and many others,
ready to work with [ArduinoThread](https://github.com/ivanseidel/ArduinoThread) and fully object oriented.

This library was made to provide lot's of out-of-the-box features, such as 'Interfaces', 'Threadable' sensors,
and reliability over C++ Objects.

If you are a developer, please consider developing more sensor Libraries following the given pattern. I will be
pleased to incorporate it to the library!

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/ivanseidel/Arduino-Sensors/releases) the Latest release from gitHub.
2. Unzip and modify the Folder name to "DueTimer" (Remove the '-version')
3. Paste the modified folder on your Library folder (On your `Libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks or Arduino software).
4. Download and Install [ArduinoThread](https://github.com/ivanseidel/ArduinoThread)
5. Restart the Arduino IDE
